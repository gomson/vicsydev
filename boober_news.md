Yesterday, after I suffered through the latest empty [apology] (https://newsroom.uber.com/a-profound-apology/) from the PR department of Travis Boober Kalanick; I [posted](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=13760405) the following comment on Hacker News. While I realise this might seem like overreacting to some, this is my perspective and I'm perfectly willing to back it up.

```
Sorry Travis; once an asshole, always an asshole; all the leadership training in the world isn't going to change that. 

You're 40 years old, how long would you have us waiting? 
Even brother J. was on your tail in noting that bad trees don't give good fruit. 

Claiming 'profound' for PR-bullshit like this when you're in that kind of mess is just another nail in the coffin.
```

The comment caught on to something and went slightly viral for a while, until around noon today when I got this reply from HN user ```dang```:

```
 You can't attack another human being like this here, regardless of who they are or how you hate them. It degrades the community. 
 
 Also, I'm sure you wouldn't want anyone to place this kind of judgment on you.

Because this type of comment is not welcome here, I'm going to kill this one now, as well as the other ones in which you've been venting. 

Please don't vent on HN.
```

Since that reply, I haven't been able to post any replies in the thread. Which is of course helping the Travis apologising groupies free space to twist the discussion and contain the damage done, since no one else will step up after seeing me get banned for expressing my view.

Of course we can judge other humans from their actions. The more authority a person has, and the more serious the consequences of their actions; the more imperative that they *are* judged from their actions, rather than the words of their PR departments and wishful thinking.

This is pure censoring from any perspective, to protect the private interests of powerful individuals against the people; not exactly the kind of behaviour you expect to see from a supposedly forward-striving, technology-oriented site like Hacker News. Maybe it's about time they renamed the site to better fit the new direction.

While I realise that stepping on these kinds of toes in public will potentially put me in the middle of an epic shit storm; I'm a firm believer in transparency as an antidote to injustice and bullying; anything less just leaves the whole mess for our children to clean up.

peace, out
