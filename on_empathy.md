### empathy
There's plenty of talk about the need to practice empathy these days. Unfortunately, the only kind of empathy that's recognized and preached as such is the kind that increases profits by making users happy and letting management off the hook.

### real empathy
There is, however; another, more authentic kind of empathy. The kind that recognizes that we're all one, literally; the kind that knows that when someone wins, we all win; the kind that never wishes for anyone to loose.

### competition
The prevailing attitude among peers in today's software industry is one of fierce competition. Anyone who's ever posted original content that threatened to rock the boat knows what I'm talking about; unless you're considered an authority that is, egos totally dig authorities.

### changing direction
Ten years ago, I took a 20m free fall to the ground while out mountain climbing with a friend; smashing one of my vertibraes and setting me up for a life time of chronic pain. I was 20 years into a successful software developer career at the time, bringing home $5k a month; and expected to be able to continue my frivolous, economically independent life style for quite some time. While I wouldn't trade the change of direction for anything in the world, I often miss not having to worry about money. For several years I tried getting back in the saddle; trying to find companies desperate enough for my extensive experience to be willing to compromise enough on rules and regulations for me to feel at home. Which finally brought me to the point where I briefly considered giving up entirely, since human needs no longer seem to be on the radar in our industry.

### sharing
I've spent 32 years of my life diligently practicing the art of writing software on a daily basis in my free time. It was never primarily about the money for me, but rather about the creative potential that I see. Even though no one seems to be willing to hire me any more, I still need to express myself creatively and share my discoveries with peers. So for the last year or so, I've been doing [exactly that](https://github.com/codr4life); going all in to share my ideas openly with the world. Hundreds of thousands of people have since read [the](http://vicsydev.blogspot.de/) [articles](https://github.com/codr4life/vicsydev) I've written, hundreds of people showed interest in the code; and I managed to get several first page hits on Hacker News.

### helping out
But despite all the activity around, and interest in the articles and projects I posted; and despite repeatedly stretching out my hands and [asking for help](https://www.paypal.me/c4life); to this day, not a single person bothered enough to put their money where their mouth is. While I know that $20 makes no difference to a lot of people, to me it means that half of my weekly medicine costs are covered. Talking about empathy still seems to be a lot more popular than actually practicing it.

peace, out
