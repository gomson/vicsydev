# [vicsy/dev](https://github.com/codr4life/vicsydev) | syncing the virtual DOM
posted Feb 28th 2017, 4:00 pm

### preramble
The virtual DOM implementation described in a previous [post](https://github.com/codr4life/vicsydev/blob/master/virtual_dom.md) has several use cases where content is relatively static once generated but the process still gains from a structured approach to generating it. And since nodes in the DOM are addressable; may have their content updated, and their HTML re-generated; all the pieces needed for dynamic updates are already in place. Separating concerns this way allows user code to decide how much control it wants to trade for convenience.
 
### use
Documents track updates when ```dynamic?``` is true. Each element keeps track of it's own ```update?``` status, which is set to true once the element has it's HTML generated. ```html-update-script``` returns a script containing the jQuery incantations needed to update the browser with all changes since last call. 

```
CL4L-HTML> (let* ((doc (html-doc :dynamic? t))
                  (body (html-body doc)))
             (html-script doc :id :jquery-js :src "scripts/jquery.js")
             (princ (to-html doc))

             (let ((hdr (html-h body 1 :id :hdr :body "foo")))
               (setf (html-style hdr :text-decoration) "underline")
               (html-a hdr :id :lnk
                           :href "http://www.foo.com"
                           :body "click me"))
    
             (princ (html-update-script doc)))

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head id="head"><script id="jquery-js" src="scripts/jquery.js"></script></head>
<body id="body"/>
</html>

$('#body').append('<h1 id="hdr">foo</h1>');
$('#hdr').attr('style', 'text-decoration: underline');
$('#hdr').append('<a href="http://www.foo.com" id="lnk">click me</a>');
```
 
### implementation
We're going to side-step the complexity of diffing content by simply logging updates when the virtual DOM is modified; this also fits better with the stated goal of supporting both static, dynamic and mixed HTML-generating scenarios. Included below are the parts of the implementation that deal with updates in any way; the actual update is performed by calling ```(update-html root "...")```. Please excuse the use of ```define-fn``` and ```define-body```; the reason for their presence is to enable gradual, whole-system [optimisation](https://github.com/codr4life/cl4l/blob/master/cl4l.lisp).
